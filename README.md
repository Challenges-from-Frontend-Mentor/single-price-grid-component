## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM methodology
- Mobile first

### What I learned

This one was pretty easy too! I added BEM methodology and did mobile layout first.

Some snippets:

> The BEM methodology in HTML:

```html
<div class="section-2">
    <div class="section-2__title">Monthly Subscription</div>
    <div class="section-2__price">
    <span class="section-2__value">&dollar;29</span
    ><span class="section-2__frequency"> per month</span>
    </div>
    <div class="section-2__subtitle">
    Full access for less than &dollar;1 a day
    </div>
    <div class="section-2__sign-up-button">Sign Up</div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I'm still learning BEM methodology and trying to make my code more clean and reusable!
